## MiniQuest Overview

MiniQuest is an exciting RPG adventure game. Play as a simple farmer who turns into a heroic dragon-slayer. Explore a vast world, hone your strategic gameplay, and meet a variety of characters.

## Gameplay

You can roam through multiple distinct maps, each filled with unique quests, enemies, loot, and more. Use the `E` key to interact with objects and NPCs, and `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to control character movement. Left-click to attack, and use `I` and `Esc` keys to manage inventory and game settings.

## Level Design

The game consists of a sprawling world map subdivided into unique, smaller maps. These can range from dense forests to lively towns. These maps are interconnected, offering areas that are immediately accessible and others that are unlocked as you progress. Each area boasts its own unique layout and theme.

## Character Progression

Starting as a level one farmer, you can progress by gaining new skills and collecting valuable items. Earn experience points by defeating enemies and completing quests, and use them to enhance your abilities. Interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) can lead to new quests, special items, and even companionship.

## Story and Characters

Your peaceful life as a farmer is shattered by a dragon attack, setting you on a journey for revenge. Along the way, you'll forge new friendships and uncover truths that will shake you to your core. Your choices influence the narrative, character relationships, and the final outcome.

## Art and Sound

MiniQuest features a 16-bit RPG-style pixel art design. The soundtrack combines elements of orchestral, folk, and fantasy music. Sound effects and ambient sounds add to the immersion and responsiveness of the game world.

## Technical

MiniQuest is initially designed for Windows, developed using the Pygame library in Python. The game also leverages Tilemaps to create efficient grid-based environments.
