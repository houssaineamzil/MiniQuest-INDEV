## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player can interact with the world in various ways. MiniQuest features multiple maps, which the player can traverse and explore. Each map has its own quests, enemies, loot, puzzles and much more. Players will be able to interact with objects around the world. For example, a player may be able to access chests, reads signs around the world, talk to NPCS, cast spells, complete quests and slay monsters.

### Controls
The player can move their character using the WASD keys. W moves the character forward, A moves them left, S moves them backward, and D moves them to the right. 

The player can attack enemies by left-clicking the screen. The type of attack performed depends on the weapon the character is currently holding. For example, a sword might trigger a slashing motion, while a bow would release an arrow towards the cursor.

The E key is used for interactions. This includes opening chests, entering doors, reading signs, and initiating conversations with NPCs. When near an interactable object or character, a prompt will appear on screen to inform the player that they can press E to interact.
 
The player can access their inventory and game menus by pressing the I and Esc keys, respectively. In the inventory, players can equip new items, use consumables, and view their character's stats and abilities. The game menu provides access to options such as saving and loading the game, adjusting settings, and exiting to the desktop.

### Level Design
MiniQuest employs a sprawling world map that consists of multiple, distinct smaller maps, each featuring its own unique environment, challenges, and storylines. The player's journey will lead them through a variety of landscapes - from verdant forests and treacherous mountains, to bustling towns and eerie dungeons.

The world map is vast and interconnected, fostering a sense of a continuous, cohesive world. Some areas are easily accessible from the beginning, inviting early exploration, while others are gated by story progress, character abilities, or challenging enemies, rewarding players for growth and progression.

Each smaller map or "area" is designed with its own unique layout, aesthetic, and theme. Areas may include a variety of terrains and points of interest, such as natural landmarks, NPC hubs, enemy encampments, secret paths, and treasure caches. This variety encourages thorough exploration and offers diverse gameplay experiences.

Certain areas have "inner maps" or "interiors", such as houses, castles, or dungeons. These interior maps often feature puzzles, quests, or enemies that are specific to that location. For example, a dungeon might be filled with traps and monsters, while a castle may contain political intrigue and hidden secrets. Interiors serve to deepen the world's lore, provide context to its inhabitants, and offer a change of pace from the outside world.

The maps are meticulously handcrafted using TileMaps. Each tile represents a piece of the environment - such as a patch of grass, a piece of wall, or a section of river - and can be combined with others to create intricate, varied landscapes. Each map features multiple layers, including collision layers to prevent players from walking through solid objects, ground layers to create the basic terrain, and above-ground layers to add details and depth.

MiniQuest's map aesthetic is inspired by the charm and nostalgia of 16-bit RPGs. Each map is visually distinct and teeming with life and color, from the subtle animation of leaves in the wind to the shifting hues of a sunset sky. Despite the top-down perspective, care is taken to create a sense of depth and perspective, making the world feel truly immersive.

### Character Progression
At the start of the game, the player begins as a humble farmer, starting at level one with only basic tools and no combat abilities. As the story unfolds, the player will have the opportunity to learn new skills, acquire valuable items, and enhance their abilities, ultimately transforming from a simple farmer into a formidable hero.

The player earns experience points (XP) by defeating enemies, completing quests, and overcoming challenges. Accumulating a certain amount of XP allows the player to level up, which not only enhances their base stats like health, strength, and intelligence but also gives them skill points to spend on new abilities.

As the player levels up, they gain access to new skills and abilities. These can range from combat abilities like a powerful sword strike or a healing spell, to non-combat abilities like crafting or negotiation. The player is free to choose which abilities to acquire and enhance, allowing them to customize their character to their preferred playstyle.

The world of MiniQuest is filled with hidden treasures, special items, and powerful equipment. As the player explores, they will find weapons to increase their combat abilities, armor to protect them from damage, artifacts with special effects, and resources that can be used to craft new items. Some items will be straightforward to find, while others will require solving challenging puzzles, defeating powerful enemies, or completing complex quests.

Over the course of their journey, the player will encounter a variety of non-player characters (NPCs). Interacting with these characters can lead to new quests, access to special items, or even companionship. Building relationships with NPCs can enhance the player's abilities in a variety of ways, and can also lead to new narrative possibilities.
