## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player can interact with the world in various ways. MiniQuest features multiple maps, which the player can traverse and explore. Each map has its own quests, enemies, loot, puzzles and much more. Players will be able to interact with objects around the world. For example, a player may be able to access chests, reads signs around the world, talk to NPCS, cast spells, complete quests and slay monsters.

### Controls
The player can move around the world with WASD controls. Left clicking the screen will attack with whichever weapon the player is currently holding. Clicking E will interact with objects around the world, such as chests, doors, signs and NPCs.

### Level Design
The world map consists of multiple smaller maps, that the player can travel through. Some maps have "inner maps", like a house or building. Maps will be created using "TileMaps" complete with collision layers, ground and above ground layers. The art style of maps will be similar to that of a 16bit top-down RPG.
